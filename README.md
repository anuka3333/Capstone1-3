# 📸 Anuka Photos – Capstone Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Anuka Photos**, my personal photography website and final capstone project for the **Northwestern University Front-End Development Certificate Program**.

## 🌟 About the Project

This website serves as the digital home for **Anuka Photos**, a photography company I founded to capture portraits, live events, hospitality spaces, and creative moments in Chicago and beyond.

Built with **React.js**, this project showcases my ability to design, develop, and deploy a fully responsive single-page application (SPA) using modern front-end technologies.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Present my photography work in a clean, professional, and creative layout.
- Allow potential clients to **browse galleries**, **view event highlights**, and **get in touch** through a contact form.
- Demonstrate front-end skills including routing, API data fetching, component-based design, and user input handling.
- Lay the foundation for future back-end integration and e-commerce functionality.

## 🧩 Features

✅ Structured with **React Router** for seamless multi-page navigation  
✅ Styled using **custom CSS** for a cohesive brand identity  
✅ Simulated **API calls** to fetch gallery images (mock data)  
✅ Contact form using **Formspree** for live email submission  
✅ Gallery components for **Portraits**, **Live Events**, and **Hospitality**  
✅ Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid  
✅ Tested with React Testing Library

## 🔧 Future Enhancements
