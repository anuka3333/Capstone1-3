# 📸 Anuka Photos – Capstone Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Anuka Photos**, my personal photography website and final capstone project.

## 🌟 About the Project

This website serves as the digital home for **Anuka Photos**, a photography company I founded to capture portraits, live events, hospitality spaces, and creative moments in Chicago and beyond.

Built with **React.js**, this project showcases my ability to design, develop, and deploy a fully responsive single-page application (SPA) using modern front-end technologies.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Present my photography work in a clean, professional, and creative layout.
- Allow potential clients to **browse galleries**, **view event highlights**, and **get in touch** through a contact form.
- Demonstrate front-end skills including routing, API data fetching, component-based design, and user input handling.
- Lay the foundation for future back-end integration and e-commerce functionality.

## 🧩 Features

✅ Structured with **React Router** for seamless multi-page navigation  
✅ Styled using **custom CSS** for a cohesive brand identity  
✅ Simulated **API calls** to fetch gallery images (mock data)  
✅ Contact form using **Formspree** for live email submission  
✅ Gallery components for **Portraits**, **Live Events**, and **Hospitality**  
✅ Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid  
✅ Tested with React Testing Library

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- React.js
- JSX
- React Router DOM
- CSS (custom styling)
- Formspree (for contact form handling)
- Unsplash (for placeholder gallery images)
- Git & GitHub (version control)

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- 📅 Integrate a **calendar booking system** so clients can schedule sessions directly through the site  
- 🛍️ Embed a **Shopify storefront** for merch and print sales — offloading payments and compliance while maintaining a custom shop layout  
- 🌐 Connect to a **custom back-end API** to fetch real photography session data and store form submissions securely

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/anuka3333/capstone1-3.git

cd capstone1-3

npm install

npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
